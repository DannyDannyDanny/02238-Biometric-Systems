# Finger Knuckle Print (FKP)
## 02238-Biometric-Systems


### Data
The THU-FVFDT3 contains 4x610 raw images of fingers.

A subset of THU-FVFDT2 contains Regions of Interest (ROIs) of finger dorsal texture from 610 different subjects.

Several images of each subject's finger are taken.

ROIs are extracted

the first 220 ROIs of which are extracted from THU-FVFDT1.

The last 390 ROIs are captured in two different sessions with interval ranging from about three days to one week.

One session is for training and the other for testing.

Each ROI is normalized to 200*100 pixels.
